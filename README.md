      <article>This is above the fold content that must render ASAP</article>
      <OnIdle>
        <aside>This heavy component can be rendered when the browser is idle</aside>
      </OnIdle>
    </section>
  }
}
```

### Dependencies
React Idle doesn't have any direct dependencies. Since it's meant to be used with React, it expects that your project aready depends on [`react`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react) and [`react-dom`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-dom).

NPM will not automatically install these dependencies for you, but it will show a friendly warning message with instructions.

## Configuration
| Property | Type | Required? | Description |
|:---|:---|:---:|:---|
| children | React Node | âœ“ | Children you want to render on idle |
| placeholder | React Node |  | Placeholder component that shows before the render takes place |
| onRender | Function |  | Callback executed after render completes. No arguments provided. |
| skipSSR | Boolean |  | Use this property to prevent the children from being rendered in Server Side Rendering. Defaults to false. |
| syncUpdate | Boolean |  | Use this property to render updates immediately instead of triggering another `onIdle` process. Defaults to false. |
